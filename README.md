# LibraNet: Library Management System üìö

A robust, extensible, and object-oriented library management system designed in Java. This project simulates the core functionalities of "LibraNet," an online platform for managing books, audiobooks, and e-magazines.

---
## üìù Project Overview

This system is a solution to a design challenge that required building a reusable and future-ready class structure for an online library. It demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation** to manage different types of library items with shared and specialized behaviors.

The core of the system is the `LibraNet` class, which acts as a controller, managing a collection of `LibraryItem` objects and handling operations such as borrowing, returning, and fine calculation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Hierarchical Class Structure**: Uses an `abstract` base class `LibraryItem` with specialized subclasses (`Book`, `Audiobook`, `EMagazine`).
* **Common Operations**: All items support common library actions like `borrow()`, `returnItem()`, and checking availability.
* **Specialized Behaviors**:
    * `Book`: Tracks page count.
    * `Audiobook`: Has a playback duration and a `play()` method.
    * `EMagazine`: Includes an issue number and can be archived using `archiveIssue()`.
* **Fine Calculation**: Automatically calculates and reports fines for overdue items based on a predefined daily rate (‚Çπ10/day).
* **Robust Data Handling**: Manages item IDs and borrowing records using `HashMap` for efficient lookups.
* **Clear Error Messaging**: Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid operations (e.g., returning an item that isn't borrowed).

## üèõÔ∏è System Design and Architecture

The project is designed around a clean, hierarchical class structure that promotes code reuse and makes it easy to add new item types in the future.

### Class Structure

* `LibraryItem` **(Abstract Class)**
    * This is the foundation of our design. It defines the common attributes (`itemId`, `title`, `author`, `isBorrowed`) and methods that all library items must have. The `getDetails()` method is `abstract`, forcing subclasses to provide their own specific implementation.

* `Book`, `Audiobook`, `EMagazine` **(Concrete Subclasses)**
    * These classes `extend` `LibraryItem` and add their unique properties and methods. Each class provides a custom implementation of the `getDetails()` method to display its unique information.

* `LibraNet` **(The System Core)**
    * This class orchestrates all library operations. It holds the business logic for borrowing, returning, and calculating fines, using `Map` collections to store items and borrowing records.

* `Main` **(The Driver Class)**
    * This class serves as the entry point and demonstrates the system's functionality by creating library items, performing operations, and simulating user interactions.

## üöÄ How to Run the Code

1.  **Save the Code**: Ensure all classes are saved in their respective `.java` files (e.g., `LibraryItem.java`, `Book.java`, `Main.java`) in the same directory.
2.  **Compile**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory, and compile the source code:
    ```sh
    javac Main.java
    ```
3.  **Run**: Execute the compiled code to see the simulation:
    ```sh
    java Main
    ```

## ### Example Usage

The complete `main` method below serves as a driver class to demonstrate the full functionality of the library system. The numbered comments explain each step of the process.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // 1. Initialize the library system
    LibraNet libraNet = new LibraNet();

    // 2. Populate the library with various items
    System.out.println("--- Populating the Library ---");
    Book book1 = new Book(110, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", "J.K. Rowling", 435);
    Book book2 = new Book(115, "The 3 Mistakes of My Life", "Chetan Bhagat", 258);
    Audiobook audiobook1 = new Audiobook(210, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring", "J.R.R. Tolkien", 1257);
    EMagazine emagazine1 = new EMagazine(310, "National Geographic Traveller India", "ACK Media", 150);

    libraNet.addItem(book1);
    libraNet.addItem(book2);
    libraNet.addItem(audiobook1);
    libraNet.addItem(emagazine1);

    // 3. Display the initial state of the library catalog
    libraNet.listAllItems();

    // 4. Simulate borrowing different items
    System.out.println("\n--- Borrowing Items ---");
    libraNet.borrowItem(115, 7); // Normal borrow for 1 week
    libraNet.borrowItem(310, 10); // Borrow e-magazine
    libraNet.borrowItem(210, 20, LocalDate.now().minusDays(25)); // Simulate an overdue borrow for fine calculation

    // 5. Display the list of currently borrowed items
    libraNet.listBorrowedItems();

    // 6. Simulate returning the items
    System.out.println("\n--- Returning Items ---");
    libraNet.returnItem(115); // On-time return
    libraNet.returnItem(210); // Overdue return, which should trigger a fine

    // 7. Test the error handling for an invalid return
    System.out.println("\n--- Testing Error Case ---");
    libraNet.returnItem(110); // This item was never borrowed
    
    // 8. Display the final status of the library
    System.out.println("\n--- Final Library Status ---");
    libraNet.listBorrowedItems();
    libraNet.listAllItems();
}
```

## üí° Future Enhancements

This project provides a strong foundation that can be extended with more advanced features to make it even more robust and feature-rich:

* **Implement a `Playable` Interface**: Fulfill the original challenge requirement by creating a `Playable` interface with a `play()` method. The `Audiobook` class (and future media types like `VideoLecture`) would implement this, promoting a more flexible design.

* **Introduce True Exception Handling**: Replace `System.out.println` error messages with custom exceptions (e.g., `ItemNotFoundException`, `ItemAlreadyBorrowedException`). This makes error management more robust and suitable for larger applications.

* **Add a `User` or `Member` Class**: Create a class to represent library members. This would allow the system to track who has borrowed which item, manage user-specific fine totals, and maintain a borrowing history for each member.

* **Implement Data Persistence**: Save the library's catalog and borrowing records to a file (like JSON or CSV) or a simple database (like SQLite). This ensures that the library's state isn't lost when the application closes.

* **Add Search Functionality**: Implement methods in the `LibraNet` class to allow searching for items by **title**, **author**, or **item type**. This is a critical feature for any real-world library system.

* **Parse String Durations**: Enhance the borrowing method to parse durations from string inputs (e.g., "7d" for 7 days, "2w" for 2 weeks), as mentioned in the original problem description.
